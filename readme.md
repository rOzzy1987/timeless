Timeless is a watchface for Garmin Connect IQ compatible devices, which is focused on daily calories and steps instead of time.

## Features
The main features are:

- Step count displayed on top.
- Calories displayed on bottom.
- Set up a calories goal and track progress with the top left-bottom right diagonal lines. As you are nearing your goal, the lines fill up the background.
- Track step goal in a similar way, but using the bottom left-top right diagonal lines.
- Minimal analog clock: dot represents hours, line represents minutes.
- Configurable colors for every display element, almost any of them can be hidden.

## Installing
Install from ConnectIQ application or build and deploy via USB.

- Sarpanch font: [source](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarpanch)

## Footnote
Timeless is available for free in the ConnectIQ store [here](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/7e7e0e0a-49a3-4df0-8ec4-25eca9e3063f), and open source as you see.
